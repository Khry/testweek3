          When rappers aren't good enough lyricists to have fans or just want some publicity, they will copy Tupac and Biggy and set up a beef with another rapper.

Their auidence of mainly wannabe gangsta rich white folk love this because if they meet another wannabe gangsta who listens to a rival of their favourite rapper, they are allowed to exchange poorly thoughtup insults such as 'yo mama'.
The Game: Grrr...I am rich, famous but I am street which means I am required by law to have a beef with another rapper. 50 cent is fake and so is G-Unit.

50 cent: I am not fake even though after that shooting I am now 76% mechnical parts. I mention my shooting as much as possible because it means I am hardcore and it doesn't occur to people that the shooter was just a lousy shot. I am hardcore so buy my records. If you buy my records, that means you are hardcore?

          Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨?) is a type of food preparation originating in Japan, consisting of cooked vinegared rice (鮨飯 sushi-meshi) combined with other ingredients (ネタ neta) such as raw seafood, vegetables and sometimes tropical fruits. Ingredients and forms of sushi presentation vary widely, but the ingredient which all sushi have in common is rice (also referred to as shari (しゃり) or sumeshi (酢飯)). Although commonly mistaken for sushi, sashimi, which is also a Japanese delicacy, consists of thinly sliced raw fish and may or may not be served with rice.

Sushi can be prepared with either brown or white rice. It is often prepared with raw seafood, but some common varieties of sushi use cooked ingredients and many are vegetarian. Sushi is often served with pickled ginger, wasabi, and soy sauce. Popular garnishes are often made using daikon.        </p>
